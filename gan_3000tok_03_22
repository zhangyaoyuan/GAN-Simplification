9.Negative Dataset was save in to prepare_data/good_train_clean.out.5000.
10.Finetuen the discriminator begin !!!!!
the source data in training cnn is prepare_data/good_train_clean.src.5000
the positive data in training cnn is prepare_data/good_train_clean.dst.5000
the negative data in training cnn is prepare_data/good_train_clean.out.5000
train begin
